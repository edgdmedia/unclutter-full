# Unclutter: Project Overview

Unclutter is a modular mental health platform designed to empower users with tools for personal growth, therapy, journaling, financial wellness, and community engagement. The system is built for flexibility: users can access all features in a single app, or as separate apps, with a unified account and shared profile.

## Core Principles
- Modular: Each major feature is a plugin/module, allowing independent development and deployment.
- Unified Profile: One account and profile system across all features.
- API-first: All business logic and data access via custom REST APIs.
- Mobile-first: PWAs for mobile, with desktop support via theme or PWA.
- Future-proof: Data and logic decoupled from WordPress for easy migration.

## MVP Focus
- Start with Therapy & Bookings, then Journalling, then Finance, etc.

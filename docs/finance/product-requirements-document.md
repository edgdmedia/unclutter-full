# Unclutter Finance Plugin - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the product requirements for the Unclutter Finance Plugin, designed to help individuals track their finances, budget effectively, and set and achieve savings goals.

### 1.2 Scope
The initial version (MVP) will focus on core personal finance management capabilities for individual users, with potential expansion to couple/shared finances in future versions.

### 1.3 Product Overview
The Unclutter Finance Plugin is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) with a WordPress-based backend, tightly integrated with the Unclutter Core Plugin. All user and account references use `profile_id` from the core plugin. Authentication, permissions, notifications, and extensibility are handled via the core plugin. All custom tables use the `unclutter_` prefix.

All taxonomies (account types, income categories, expense categories, tags, etc.) are managed in a single unified categories table (e.g., `unclutter_finance_categories`) with a `type` column to distinguish usage (e.g., `account_type`, `income`, `expense`, `tag`).
